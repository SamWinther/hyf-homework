        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <strong>
            <p>I have born on earth on one of the coldest nights of mid summer. Through the first two years I could drink more than 2000L of milk and it was a milestone in my life.</p>
            <p>As I can remember, as soon as I could tie my shoes myself, I have never asked anyone to do it for me. I eat a lot. That's why I was the introducer of fried orange to the world at 1957.</p>
            <p>Currently, I live in a cave in australia and use bus to come to Mardid everyday. Last time I used metro, due to lack of signal under the ground, I lost my track and I ended up in London.</p>
